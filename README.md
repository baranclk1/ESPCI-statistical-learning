# ESPCI-statistical-learning

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the **Statistical Learning** course at ESPCI Paris - PSL. Each notebook explores a different application of ML techniques, including linear regression and PCA.

## TP1 - Linear Regression on global temperature anomalies

**Objective:**  
Model long-term climate trends using global temperature anomaly data from 1840 to 2020.


---

## TP2 - Principal component analysis

**Objective:**  
Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and analyze two different types of high-dimensional datasets:
- Human face images (for compression and reconstruction)
- Fluid dynamics snapshots (for flow pattern extraction)
