## Linear Regression on global temperature anomalies

Model long-term climate trends using global temperature anomaly data from 1840 to 2020.


## Principal component analysis

Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and analyze two different types of high-dimensional datasets:
- Human face images (for compression and reconstruction)
- Fluid dynamics snapshots (for flow pattern extraction)
